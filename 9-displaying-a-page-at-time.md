### Displaying a Text File a page at time



### Command: `more`:
The command display one section of the file at a time and allows you comfortatably scroll all the way to the end of the file.

```
$ more file_name
```


### Command: `less`:
Less Command is a Linux utility that can be used to read the contents of a text file one page (one screen) at a time. It has a faster access because if a file is large, it doesn't access the complete file, but accesses it page by page.

```
$ less file_name
```
